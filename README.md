# Inertia

Inertia is a (WIP) computational mathematics library for Rust. At the moment all development is focused on the [inertia-core](https://github.com/wjyoumans/inertia-core) crate which contains high-level wrappers to the [FLINT](https://flintlib.org/doc/), [Arb](https://arblib.org/), and [Antic](https://github.com/wbhart/antic) C libraries.
