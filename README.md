# Inertia

Inertia is a computational mathematics library for Rust designed for performance and usability. Wherever performance and usability clash we try to provide options for both.

Thanks to the C libraries [Flint](https://flintlib.org/doc/), [Arb](https://arblib.org/), and [Antic](https://github.com/wbhart/antic), Inertia provides (or will soon provide) the following functionality:

- arbitrary precision integers, rationals, reals, and complex numbers
- integers mod n
- finite fields
- p-adic/q-adic numbers
- (multivariate) polynomials over integers, rationals, reals, complex numbers, integers mod n, finite fields, p-adics/q-adics
- matrices with coefficients in integers, rationals, reals, complex numbers, integers mod n, finite fields, p-adics/q-adics
- rational functions
- number fields
- lattice reduction, FFT, factorization algorithms, and much more.
